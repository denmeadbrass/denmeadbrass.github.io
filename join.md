If you play a brass instrument why not join Denmead Brass? Whether you are an experienced brass bander or are new to banding, whether you have been playing regularly or have taken a break from playing why not come along? Having a Main Band and Training Band you will find the right level of support and challenge at Denmead Brass.

Our Training Band is great if you are learning to play a brass instrument or are feeling a bit rusty after taking a break from playing. Our Main Band, which contests in the 2nd Section, is probably right for you if you are a more experienced player.

Our rehearsals are held at Denmead Community Centre, School Lane, Denmead, PO7 6LU.

- Tuesday, 8:00pm-10:00pm   Denmead Brass
- Sunday 10:30am - 12:30pm  Denmead Brass
- Sunday 9:15am - 10:15am    Denmead Training Band

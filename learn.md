## ðŸŽº Join the Denmead Brass Revolution! ðŸŽº

Are you ready to be a part of something extraordinary? Denmead Brass is excited to announce the launch of our brand-new Beginner Brass Band Pathway project, and weâ€™ll be looking for passionate new members to join us!

Our Beginner Brass Pathway consists of two stages:

- __Initial Notes__: Designed to support children and beginners in learning a Brass instrument. Once the student is up to 5 notes, they will be encouraged to participate in the new Beginner Band.

 - __Beginner Band__: This new ensemble will allow promoted students from the Initial Notes group to join musical forces with confident students and adults who are relatively new to Brass instruments. Once a member is confident up to a Grade 3 level, they will be encouraged to participate in the existing Training Band.

Whilst predominantly being a Brass Band, percussionists are also welcome to attend and be coached.

This innovative pathway is designed to open the doors of musical opportunity to everyone in our community. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned musician or a beginner with a love for music, we want to welcome you with open arms.

By joining us, youâ€™ll not only engage in a fulfilling and inclusive leisure activity, but also help elevate the musical culture in our area. Together, weâ€™ll create harmonious connections through community involvement, education and the joy of music.

Letâ€™s make music that brings people together and enriches our community. Ready to make some noise? Join Denmead Brass today and be part of a musical movement! âœ¨

## How 

We are currently seeking funding to begin this new project in September 2024. Within our application, we'll be looking to initiate the two new ensembles. The funds will support the costs of the venue, tuition fees, community music trials, educational projects within local and supporting schools and the purchase of uniforms for new band members who might be facing financial hardship. Together, we can create vibrant musical opportunities that enrich our community and inspire the next generation of musicians.

## Why

Access to brass tuition in our local community is sorely lacking, and we are determined to change that. As a dedicated Brass Band, we want to open the doors to the myriad benefits of ensemble participation, enriching our community with the vibrant results of our rehearsals.

Over the next three years, we have an exciting goal: to nurture a youth ensemble that will compete in the Debut section of the National Youth Brass Band Championships. This journey will showcase the remarkable progress of our students, both children and adults, as they advance through the ranks of our existing Training and Main bands at Denmead Brass. Join us as we cultivate talent, foster musical excellence and build a stronger, more harmonious community.

This initiative is supported by:

- Southern Music Project (Delivery Partner)
- Denmead Parish Council
- Denmead Community Centre

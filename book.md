Add the joy of live music to your event with Denmead Brass. We play at all types of events, indoors and outside, including:

- Concerts
- Country Shows
- Fetes
- Community Celebrations
- Beer Festivals
- Care Home Entertainments
- Formal dinners
- Private Parties
- Weddings.

A full brass band too big? We can also provide smaller brass ensembles of typical 6 to 10 players.

When planning your event it is best to enquire with the band as soon as possible. This maximises the chances of players being available for the day and allows us to work with you to make the best use of the band at your event. To get the ball rolling, simply complete the form below and someone will get back to you.
